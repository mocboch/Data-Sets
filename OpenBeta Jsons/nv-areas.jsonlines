They wore their tennis shoes, tied in directly with a goldline rope, and carried a small collection of steel carabiners and knifeblade pitons.  On their initial attempts, they did not get very far.  However, some of the names they coined were the first Red Rock feature names coined by climbers.  \"Willy's Couloir\" was their name (John's friends called him by the nickname \"Willy\").  \"Sherwood Forest\" was what they called the huge wooded ledge system halfway up the face.  As adventurous thirteen-year-olds, they were fans of Robin Hood. ", "  Williamson's scouting (and persistence) ultimately paid off in 1970, when he and Keith Hogan completed a route to the summit.  They navigated up Willy's Couloir, crossed to the right through Sherwood Forest, and climbed the northern headwall to the top.

It's also across the wash from the Overlook. The wall is SE facing and visible from the Kraft parking lot. It gets lots of morning sun, and goes into the shade after noon in the winter, and after 2pm in the summer. All routes are bolt protected sport climbs. The approach is kinda long for a Red Rock sport climbing wall, but you won't deal with crowds at all, and there are other walls in the area to round out a full day."], "location": ["Your Wall is seen from the Kraft parking lot and along most of the lower part of the approach.

After Ash Meadows area follow the main wash north for a couple hundred yards (past Ash Spring Boulders) until reaching an intersecting wash from the west. Head up this wash 200 yards, staying on the right side initially, then the left side up to the base of a short cliff. Walk right along this cliff until you reach a 7 foot boulder and trees clogging the narrowed wash. Scramble up the obvious path through this notch to a vegetated landing (25ft).

At this point, there are 20ft boulders chocked above you and you have to choose left or right around them. The difficulty is the same either way. If you go left, continue up the main wash until you see Your Wall and follow your opinion of the path of least resistance to the base. I suggest going right of the 20ft boulders as this is the approach for other walls further up. Continue right and up along the discontinuous, steep wash/terrace keeping the short cliff on your left. Keep an eye out for a very smooth 20-25 foot blank face with a diagonal laser-cut seam/crack splitting it in half.

Best way to find it is to either plug in the coordinated into your phone or else study via the map function of the crag here on MP.This area is approximately half-way up the canyon - thus the crag has been named 'Midway' crag. Get yourself up into Lost Creek Canyon, either up easy 5th-class sections beyond and above Hidden Falls Wall, or by coming in from the huge ledge system above the Ragged Edges area (recommended).\u00a0Make your way up the canyon past numerous waterfalls that can all be climbed in approach shoes by making careful navigational choices. The first waterfall is the trickiest (rock shoes may help here). Climb the rock about 50 feet right of the waterfall; you should encounter a rap station around a small tree at the top. Use this rap on the way back out.The canyon starts by heading west than makes an abrupt turn to the south after about a half-dozen waterfalls. This southward section has a lot of bushes to fight through. In this section there is a huge boulder that blocks the way, but there is a sneaky hole that you can tunnel up through (fun if you find it).The canyon then angles right to the southwest, which is characterized by beautiful polished rock. You will then come to a fork where is seems like the main canyon goes left but you actually turn right (northwest) to stay in the main canyon.\u00a0This takes you through a tree-filled corridor. At the far end of the corridor you can get glimpses of the Midway Crag through the trees. High up on the far canyon wall ahead of you, it is a striking slab of varnish that runs up and left. A large wall bulks up the right flank of the slab forming a huge left-facing dihedral. Make note of its location.The canyon turns left (southwest). Follow this for another ten or fifteen minutes, keeping your eye on the intended crag above to your right. When you are directly below the crag take an inobvious ramp up and right to the base of the crag. This ramp is very thickly vegetated and loose, making it the most difficult / unpleasant section of the approach (the canyon approach is mostly pleasant). At the top of the ramp you will encounter the main dihedral (Dauntless Dihedral) and another great climb (Akagi's Folly) which starts in a smaller left-facing dihedral 20 feet down and left.The entire approach from the car to base of climb will take 2 to 2-1/2 hours.\u00a0Several adventurous options are available for descent. We chose to take a series of down-trending slabs that lead west toward the back of the canyon. Eventually a single-rope rappel off a large tree got us to the canyon floor a few hundred yards upstream of where we left it earlier in the day to reach the crag. Take the canyon back out.

Explorers and aspiring first ascenders fear not, though, because there is an ungodly amount of stone out here.We learned a couple of things on that first trip. 1) The damn rocks are a LOT further from the end of the road than they look. 2) They are also a lot higher in elevation than they look...it's a 1,000 foot elevation gain from the foot of the mountains to the first formation. It's close to a additional 1,000 feet to the base of the BIG FORMATIONS and another 1,000 feet to the summit. The scale is AWESOME. 3) There is water, but it is seasonal and a hella-epic to get to it.

We reckon it is about 500 feet in height, mostly lower angle, and more vegetated than some of the larger formations in the area.

Tunnel through it (neat). This will spit you out beneath another notch under the Social Distancing wall. Scramble up this notch, and downclimb (awkward talus) into the drainage with Trader Joe's.
