The rock quality is generally stable. A lot of route cleaning has been done, but caution should be exercised when accessing top anchors as to not drop loose rock on people below. This crag is perfect for the aspiring lead climber as it has several routes grade 5.9 and under, and it's well protected. The base of the climbing is flat, shaded by bushes, and makes a great place for kids and dogs to run around.Don't be fooled by the crag's name, which is in honor of the children's book author Richard Scarry. Many of the route are named after his characters. This wall is anything but scary.Abridged History (thanks to Bob Broilo): Most of these lines were done on natural pro in the 90's by climbers such as Andy Mayer or Talon Newton, and more recently, Victor Alvidrez and Bob Broilo. On one of them (named \"Sangre de Andy\" for the blood stain that marked the bottom for years) Andy Mayer almost died when a hold broke sending him crashing 40' feet down the rock, stopping 6-8 feet from the ground! Andy returned later to send the line. Some of these routes have also been bouldered (boldly) or soloed. Since the specifics of much of this history has been lost, the FAs are listed as those who established permanent anchors on the routes with full recognition that all of these lines have been done many times before.The initial development involved three bolted sport lines installed on the far right side of the crag, established by Scott Roberts, Bob Broilo, Katie Sauer, and Jason Hebert. John Laing and Dan Turner bolted several more in the spring of 2015, followed by a handful of additions by Vaino Kodas and doni. Six more routes were added in various spots among the crag by Lin Robinson, John Laing and Dan Turner in the Winter of 2017.There is a V3+ traverse called Sangre de Lizard that traverses all the major rock outcrops.

The climbing is on soft sandstone and is comparable in quality to the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs.  The area was first explored, starting in the Fall of 1975, by David Dahrling and David Baltz who had established thirteen moderate trad routes by December of 1976.  Further action in the late '70s by Paul Horak, Mark Dalen, Charlie Ware led to additional routes, as well as visits by such out-of-state luminaries as Andrew Embick, and Earl Wiggins.  Because of the intimidating nature of many of the lines, the area has seen very limited development since, in spite of the enormous potential.  The vast majority of the established routes are crack climbs, entirely unlike the uniform cracks of the Indian Creek variety, but of a more varied and technical nature.  Due to the soft rock, bolts and other fixed protection are rarely encountered, but nuts and cams work well. There is also excellent bouldering, the approaches are short--at most fifteen minutes from the car--and the climbing season runs from February through November. ", "  One note about local ethics:   The Malpais has traditionally been a 'ground up' area.  What few bolts and fixed pins that exist were placed on the lead.

The thing I remember about this route was leading a free-standing pillar which I think was the last pitch. I remember it because I took a fall. I had photos of this route, but lost the film somehow. While it was done as three pitches, they were short pitches. It is very high above NM Route 38 on the south side of the Red River canyon.Luke and I also did a thin smear (Hershey Squirts (I, MI4+)) that led up a thin sheet of ice that ended up going nowhere. Still, it was the hardest \"ice\" lead of my life at that point. Likewise, it is high above NM Route 38 on the south side of the Red River canyon.Later, Michael Horan and I climbed a route right next to the road (30 feet off the road). It's in the first bunch of buttresses one the left as you drive up the canyon (see photos) on the north side of NM Route 38. There's now a big pine tree at the base of the climb. When Michael and I climbed it (30 years ago!), the pine tree wasn't there. We called it the Droplet (I, WI2).All these climbs were done during January 1992, when the area saw an extraordinary amount of snow, hence the fuel for creating ice climbs. I remember Luke and I busting up through hip-deep snow to get to Hershey Squirts. That hike was murder.Attached are some images of the cliffs and where these climbs lie.

The tallest parts of the Cliffs offer up to 2000' of technical climbing/scrambling.  The rock is hard pre-Cambrian quartzite.  The first technical climb was made on the Brazos Cliffs in 1952 by George Bell, Sr., Virginia Lotz, Don Monk, and K. Bruecknerand when they climbed Easy Ridge.  Later that year, George Bell and Don Monk climbed the Great Couloir.  Over the next 20-30 years, members of the Los Alamos Mountaineers (LAM) established some 45 routes and major route variations on these cliffs.  The LAM website has an engaging write-up on the climbing history of the Brazos Cliffs.  George Bell, Sr. wrote an article on the Brazos Cliffs, published in the March 1972 (#639) issue of Trail & Timberline, on which much of this description is based. In 1986 the Los Alamos Mountaineers voted against assembling a guidebook to help preserve the sense of wildness that is so unique to these cliffs and to give future generations of climbers a chance to re-discover the cliffs for themselves. ", "  The Brazos Cliffs are on private property, and thus access is restricted (click on \"more info\" link above). ", "  The cliffs have three main parts, from west to east:  (1) the main Brazos Cliffs, (2) the Brazos Box Canyon, and (3) the Encinado Wedge.  The main Cliffs are about 2000' tall, and the Cliffs get shorter and steeper as you move east, with the Wedge being about 1000' tall.

Follow this road/trail for roughly 0.8 miles, staying on the left (west) side of the drainage, until you drop down into and cross the drainage and follow the road (actually there are several roads/branches here that all lead to the same point) up a short, steep hill to the northeast.

Stay up on this terrace and walk uphill keeping the arroyo within view and pass several small cairns along the way.  The canyon will narrow a bit and a trail will become more obvious.  The trail will then cross the arroyo (roughly 0.2 miles from the fire ring and beginning of cairns) and stay on the east side of the arroyo.  The cairns are much closer together from here on out due to Scott and Sean Stegner and the help of some friendly mushrooms.  Follow the cairns uphill generally staying from 20 to 150' above the drainage bottom (you are now on the east side of the drainage).  The trail trends north-northwest for the remainder of the hike and is steep but with many cairns until the very top.

The two classics on this formation are Mountain Mamma (5.10c) and Voodoo Child (5.12a)."], "location": ["Overview:    From the Crest Spur Trail, you are going to go North with the general goal of getting to an aspen-covered ridge that heads West, down to a log-cabin ruin, where most people leave their packs and harness up.. From the tumbled-down cabin one heads North, just above a cliff until it is possible to descend a fourth-class gully and then head South along the base of Torreon to access the climbs. Portions of this approach can be tricky.  ", "  Details:    The aspen-covered ridge that heads down to the West is easily visible from the crest spur trail unless there is thick fog. A problematic portion of the limestone band lies between you and the aspen ridge. There are at least two ways to get onto the ridge. Currently (2009) it is popular to head North from the FIRST switchback in the spur trail. There is a well trodden path with a grey post in front whose purpose appears to warn you that the well trodden path to the North is not the spur trail. The idea is to walk along above the limestone cliff to a particular place where a few 5.2ish moves punctuated with ledges get you to the base of the limestone band and onto the aspen-covered ridge. Presently (2009), a dead, double trunked tree is a landmark. The top of the cliff is a tad more trodden here, where lots of people have peered off the edge saying things like, \u0093I think this is the place.\u0094 or \u0093It looks like this will go.\u0094 A problem is that a trodden path continues North from here, so one could pass up this down-climb spot and waste a considerable amount of time. It helps to go with someone who knows where the down-climb spot is. Once on the aspen-covered ridge, it narrows as you progress down and leads you to a log-cabin ruin (still here in 2009). The ridge ends at a beautiful overlook. The back side of Torreon is to the West. ", "  A second alternative is to continue down the spur trail to the SECOND switch back. Similar to the first switchback, there is a trodden path heading North and a grey post whose purpose appears to be to warn you that this is not the trail. Presently (2009), the trodden path takes you to a place where a dead log is holding tons of scree from cascading down a gully. RESIST the temptation to go down the well trodden gully. This mistake leads to crossing lots of unstable soil/scree and huffing to gain the aspen-covered ridge. Instead, cross the scree above the log and stay with the base of the limestone cliff, where there is presently no trail. Hugging or staying just below the base of the cliff keeps you on relatively stable soil although currently involves bushwhacking through Gamble Oaks. Fret not. By staying with the base of the cliff, the bushwhack over to the aspen covered ridge is short. You know you are there when the limestone band offers a toe which has a relatively luxurious growth of orange lichen. It is now a short stroll down the aspen-covered ridge to the tumble-down cabin.  ", "  Once a climber trail is established through the Gamble Oak in the stable soil near or along the base of the limestone band, this may become the preferred approach. There is no need to incorporate the section of existing trodden path. This route is a nice alternative when returning if you timed your top-out of Torreon just before the rain started. It is nice to avoid climbing the limestone band in the rain.  ", "  Now your goal is to find your way into the gully that is to the North of the cabin site. There are many eroded paths from many people fumbling the approach to the gully. All the wrong ones lead to one of many fifth-class descents which you may choose to rappel, climb down, or back away from, causing more soil erosion. Your goal is to find the fourth-class decent. Heading North and down from the cabin will probably take you to a well-trodden trail. It affords views over the edge of the 1st gully that let you know you are not there yet. The fourth class entrance to the correct 2nd gully is about 100 paces from the cabin site. Local landmarks are: The gully has a wee head wall. You bypass it by going North and then making a switchback near two large Douglas Fir trees. They are the biggest ones around. You should be looking into a trodden gully that heads West (probably to your right) and the short headwall of the gully is probably up to your left. There may be a small cairn at your feet. This is it \u0097 the only entrance to a legitimately fourth class way down this gully. [Note: If you have really found this spot, you did not stumble down any loose, eroded soil to get here from the cabin ruin, you did not need your hands, you have not done any substantial descending yet. Therefore, you are in the wrong place if you are contemplating doing any of these things without seeing a fourth class gully and its short headwall, which you just skillfully bypassed.] The way is now clear for a long, steep hike down. You will pass the foot of a bright-green-lichen arete. After a while you will be stumbling down loose scree and talus in the woods, clearly following the path of those who have done it before you. When in doubt of whether to scramble down into a gully over large talus, instead curve to the skier\u0092s left (South) to more-or less hug the base of Torreon.  ", "  Topping out:    Scramble to the tippy top of Torreon. Look off the east side. There is a fat pine that probably sports various vintage slings, cords, descending rings, quick-links, etc. It is good to rap with one 60-m rope to avoid problems getting a knot stuck. When descending, try to stay to the climber\u0092s right to go over the big blocks. Your object is to land on the saddle that connects Torreon to the mountain. After pulling the rope, leave your harness on, traverse East and climb the gully Northeast. It should be obvious to take care not to fall out of the bottom of the gully. After some scrambling there will probably be a fixed rope \u0097 the reason you left your harness on. Climbing the wall to the right is easier but will result in more of a swing if you fall. After a bit more huffing up the gully, the tumble-down cabin site appears on your right.  ", "  Continuing down from the base of Torreon:    The backside of the top of the Mexican Breakfast crag is directly across from Voodoo Child. There is a talus saddle between it and Torreon. Ostensibly, you can climb down the talus on either side to get to the base. Going around the South side works, and goes past the point where Mexican Breakfast finishes, where the ridge of the crag drops down to the talus level.

There are three established routes on the front face: left, middle, \u00a0 ad right. Left is the easiest; the crux is getting off the ground. Right is \u00a0 next, although it is the most balancy of the three. Middle is technically easier than right, but much more committing. I found a new (?) line between \u00a0 the middle and right lines (2.5 below). \u00a0\u00a0** 1. (left) The easiest way up is to climb the front side using the edge. A better way is to climb on the face by the edge, but without using the edge. The top has big jugs on the right -- and you can always grab the edge if you feel uncomfortable. V0 with the edge, V1- without, but with a V1+ move off the ground. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0** 2. (middle) Hard start like the other two; tricky feet as you set up on high holds, then you must commit to moving your feet over the buldge, reaching for a very strong flake (you can sink 3-4 fingers behind it) to make the next move. After that things are easier: better feet and positive holds, ending with jugs at the top. Just V1+, but committing, so let's call it V2-. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0** 2.5. (middle-right) More committing than the middle line, because the holds are mostly tiny sidepulls, forcing you to lieback your way over the bulge. At V2, the most technical of the four lines on the front face. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0* 3. (right) An easier start than the other two, but funky once you're off the ground. Use the right edge -- otherwise the difficulty goes up \u00a0 \u00a0 seriously. Once you have the big black knob, use it with your right hand as \u00a0a sidepull and move straight up to reach the edge, then follow the edge up. From the black knob on, you can always duck off to the right any time you get uncomfortable. V1+. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0** 1-3 traverse (low down -- just off the ground). Tricky in the middle, where handholds are tiny and scarce and feet tend to slip. Easier to do left-to-right than right-to-left. V1+?\u00a0Backside of the fin: a fun lieback exercise: go up the entire fin and \u00a0across the other side, then make the round trip -- coming back down \u00a0towards the west all the way to the ground is the hardest part. \u00a0V0+ (perhaps V1- for the last two moves coming down).
