Many have spent lifetimes searching for the elusive and warm yellow-orange glow of gold. Few have found it, and some have found only heartache, or even death. Climbers of Arizona, and in particular the Superstition Mountains, have also sought riches of their own.

A day here is one filled with hard work, mind numbing vistas, sweat, blood, and a beauty only exposed with your fist and your heart deeply entwined in its hard, unrelenting core.   This area was explored, and the routes established, when a few people became entranced by its allure, not unlike the lure of gold. It is a traditional climbing area. The rock is unique for the area, and while loose and dirty rock exists it is the exception, not the rule. Besides, if you were on perfect rock you'd forget you were in the Superstitions! Due to the northern exposure and frequency of water dripping down its face the rock has a rough, hardened surface.

{"area_name": "Monument Valley", "description": ["Monument Valley is on the Navajo Indian Reservation in the 4 corners area of the Colorado Plateau.  It is in NE Arizona, and SE Utah.  It is 29,817 acres, and at an elevation of 5564 feet. The Tribal Park was established in 1958 by the Navajo Tribe.  There is a visitor's center, a small campground, and a 1-way dirt road loop you can drive for a small fee.  Climbing is illegal in the Tribal Park, as well as hiking off the loop road.  There are a few residential homes here and there in the Tribal Park, and locals try to sell various crafts to the tourists around the Tribal Park.  This area is one of the planet's most scenic wonders, and the rock formations in the Tribal Park are some of the world's most amazing rock formations, pinnacles, mesas, spires, and cliffs. It is an area of unbelievable beauty.  This area has been photographed to the point where the whole world has seen the vistas, views, scenes, and formations of this amazing area.  Hollywood has also taken advantage of this area, and Monument Valley has been the backdrop for many movies and TV commercials. One of the Tribal Parks more amazing spires is The Totem Pole, perhaps the world's tallest and skinniest spire.  The Navajo Tribe has strictly stuck to their rule of no rock climbing in the Tribal Park, but with Hollywood money, we have seen Clint Eastwood and George Kennedy \"climb\" the Totem Pole, McGyver land a handglider on the Totem Pole's summit, and Xerox put a desk with a secretary on top of the Pole's summit as well.  There have been clandestine ascents of most of the area's formations, and I believe a few climbers have been caught climbing in the Park and had their gear taken away from them.  It is probably best NOT to climb in the Tribal Park, especially the formations on and near the one-way dirt loop road.  Some of the other formations away from the Tribal Loop Road are less scrutinized by the Tribal Authorities, and are less of a risk for would-be poachers.  Still, it is against The Navajo Tribes wishes and laws to climb within the Tribal Park, and anywhere on the Navajo Indian Reservation, for that matter, and most people adhere to their wishes."], "location": ["The Tribal Park is about 25 miles NE of the town of Keyenta, Arizona."], "path": "Northern Arizona|Navajolands|Monument Valley", "us_state": "Arizona", "url": "https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105964237/monument-valley", "lnglat": [-110.06023, 36.93989], "metadata": {"lnglat_from_parent": false}}

Otherwise, drive as towards Blue Spring on FS Road 6481 (see Tomasi description for start). There is no way to describe precisely what\u2019s in store for you on this drive, as things change all the time. Your basic goal is to get out toward Cape Solitude, so follow your intuition and the most traveled road towards Blue Spring.

{"area_name": "Bear Gun, The", "description": ["A small but nice dual summit tower located away from the base of the large Coconino walls.As the story goes, in 1885, Richard \"Bear\" Wilson was excited by the tracks of a monstrous \"grizzly\" bear near present day Sedona, and was planning to hunt the animal as soon as his bear gun got back from the shop. But when Wilson saw the bear, he couldn't resist and went after it with only his small caliber rifle, shooting it multiple times. Throwing all caution into the wind he followed the wounded behemoth up a small box canyon. This was not fortuitous. The mama bear charged him and he attempted to shelter in a tree but she pulled him out. Wilson fought with his knife and wounded her further, as evidenced by the large trail of blood later found leading away from the scene. His knife was nowhere to be found and it was presumably lodged in the animal. In the end, she severely mauled Wilson and left him to die face down in the muck.Years later, Fred Thompson, Oak Creek Canyon homesteader and Wilson's one time employer, found the remains of a huge bear on top of the mountain, ostensibly the same one. The consensus is that Wilson mortally wounded the bear, so they named her final resting place in his honor.The moral of the story is: if lacking the proper gear, you should still go for it, but sometimes it might not go your way. Or something like that.This tower was first climbed by Cameron Kern (famous for taking a 90' slab fall on Dresdoom!) and Pete McFarland in the early 1990s via a route called \"The Lift is Still Turning\" on the south Face - 2 pitches, one traversing east and one going up to the top, 5.10.The first ascensionists didn't name the tower so I decided to call it The Bear Gun because it somewhat resembles a double barrel shotgun (from the right angle), but mostly because of the history of Dick Wilson, and his calamitous ending due to the lack of his bear gun."], "location": ["Take the North Wilson Mountain trail for about 15 minutes.

Troll Tower is the first formation that is encountered, and is identified by its clean, steep west face which hosts two quality sport climbs. Across the canyon stands the Wall of the Trundling Trolls, and its impressive southeast face is a spectacular sight with its myriad quality crack systems. Add to this idyllic scene a stream that runs virtually year round, and you have one of Mt Lemmon\u0092s finest climbing areas. The original batch of 17 routes (and two variations that were incorrectly labeled as routes) established on the Troll Wall were put up in a flurry of activity between 1980 and 1982, mostly by Michael Strassman, John Steiger, and Ray Ringle, among others. ", "  The rock quality on the Troll Wall is comparable to the very best stone on all of Mt. Lemmon. Loose holds, which are commonplace at most areas in the Santa Catalina range, are nearly absent on the highly compact stone. The absence of the sharp, crystalline rock typical of the higher elevations of the mountain, combined with the generally large size of the handholds makes this crag very finger friendly (muscles will become sore long before skin gets worn thin!) The far more abundant loose blocks that originally gave the wall its name have all been trundled, leaving incredibly clean, safe routes from one end of the wall to the other. ", "  The crack systems are some of the most protectable found on Mt. Lemmon, with solid placements usually being no more than five to ten feet apart. Perhaps the biggest difficulty now will be locating the desired route from the closely spaced crack systems that cover the face! The few bolted routes that are found one the Troll Wall ascend interesting features found on the faces between the prominent crack systems. Nearly all of the new routes have bolted belay/rappel anchors, and many of the original routes either have anchors at the top or can easily utilize nearby anchor stations for belays, rappels, or top-rope anchors. ", "  The season for climbing here runs from March through early November, with pleasant temperatures being found by staying either in the sun or shade depending upon the time of year. The summer monsoons can deliver sudden, intense storms, and it is not uncommon to be caught on a route in a downpour. These rains also bring intermittent seeps that drain from various cracks in the face, especially in the upper left portion of the wall where the highest concentration of moderate routes are located. Although the stream runs nearly all year, it is not advised to drink the water without using a purifying filter. The routes described here are listed from left to right while facing each of the particular formations."], "location": ["Although the Troll Wall used to be approached by a poor trail that descended from Rose Canyon Dam down to the confluence of Rose Canyon and upper Sycamore Canyon, the excellent trail from Munchkinland makes the old trail only useful if looking for a longer, or alternative hike into the area.

Once you get to the ridge, you will see the large rock outcropping way down and off in the distance to the west.

A visible trail is starting to take shape down this ridge although it doesn't appear until you get down the hill about 50-100 feet. Halfway down this ridge you will encounter a small rock outcropping that you will have to scramble over or around for about 20 feet or so.

As you are contouring, an exposed rock peak will become visible up above and to the west. The saddle you are looking for is on the east flank of this peak. A small ridge of rock running up and down the hill may obscure this saddle from view until you cross over the ridge of rock. Once in this saddle drop in to the north and you will find the climbs on your left, \"Sweeeeet\" you have just arrived in Southpark.

{"area_name": "Wood Canyon", "description": ["The main wall in Wood Canyon is a large, black outcrop that towers just east from the road.  The wall faces west and at its highest is roughly 30 meters.  A few sport routes exist with a few more trad and mixed routes.   The rock typically can take great gear on many routes (as tested).     The rock is a perlite flow apart of the Picket  Post Volcanic series.  Somewhat similar to a basalt flow in how it climbs.  Some routes still have loose rock and climbers, belayers, and dogs should be careful!    The first crack that was climbed here found a Chuckwalla was found 20 meters up jammed inside the crack. This is \"slack\" country AZ climbing, you may find bats, scorpions, etc. Deal with it.   The wall faces west and with the dark rock, it can get pretty hot.  Be respectful to the OHV, horseback riders, hunters, and other using Wood Canyon.  It generally is a secluded and quiet place.  Not much shade once the sun goes up until it goes behind the hills. 60 meter rope is OK, watch your ends.  Many routes have rappel anchors with quick links or steel lockers.  You may want to bring some quick links along on your lead.  The steel lockers are not booty; please leave them.  Top roping can be difficult on some of the climbs as you may have to extend the anchors.  Most anchors are over the edge of the cliff and not easily reached from above (you can easily build an anchor w/ gear above to setup a TR).  More potential exists for easy (<5.6) trad climbs on the south side of the wall for those willing to do the cleaning.  The ethic here is to not bolt mostly protect-able lines.     The cracks and pockets take nuts and cams well.  A single set of nuts, hexes, along with a single set of cams (maybe doubles of certain sizes, cams up to #4 c4) will be useful.     You could camp here, it's all USFS Tonto NF land.  No bee hives in the rocks, just friendly bees around.  Dog friendly if it isn't too hot.
